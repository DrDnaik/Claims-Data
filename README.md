# Claims-Data
Claim Processing  Efficiency Project
Claims Processing Efficiency Dashboard
This project analyzes health insurance claims processing efficiency using SQL for data insights and Tableau for visualization. The dashboard tracks KPIs such as processing time, denial rate, approval rate, and staff performance. It also evaluates the impact of policy changes and identifies bottlenecks in the claims workflow.

Data Preparation
The dataset was synthetically generated and has five tables. 
The datasets are generated in Python using the following packages.

Faker -> generating random names and IDs
Random & Numpy -> for random selections and numbers
DateTime -> for all time manipulations
Pandas -> handling the main table structure and formats
Data was cleaned and standardized (handled missing values, and date format inconsistencies). Using common attributes, joined claims with policies, providers, staff, and processing stages for comprehensive analysis.

Important Metrics
1.	Approval and Denial rates month-wise
2.	Average processing time for claims
3.	Comparison by claim type (Basic vs. Premium)
4.	Comparison by staff job grade (Junior vs. Senior)
5.	Approvals by location and Providers
6.	Denial rate trends after claim type change for specific months.
7.	Average processing hours according to staff ID
8.	Average processing time by number of customer contacts
